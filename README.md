# 2 - Habit Tracker

Second one weekend website. At some point last year, I was trying to establish some habits and I had a piece of squared paper that I tracked the habits in. It was quite satisfying and also easy to see at glance which things were going well and which things weren't. I never got around to sorting it out on a new piece of paper when I ran out of room though, so the idea here is to recreate this in a simple webpage.

To begin with, I'll just store the state in a cookie, and then think about how to persist this for users in the future.
